HIT AND RUN TRADING IN PYTHON
____________________________________

The book has 11 short term strategies that give much better insights about the market. However, one can't monitor all these strategies on a variety of stocks.
This project is a small effort towards automating the whole process with the help of python. Out of these 11, 9 can easily be coded in any programming language.
The script takes daily OPEN-High-Low-Close data of stocks in nifty500, runs the conditions of 4 major strategies against that data, and returns a buy, sell or do ignore signal.

NOTE: Whenever you see a signal on a stock, you should read about that strategy from the book and then you will have a higher probability of going right and then guessing blindly.
